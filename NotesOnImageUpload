Notes on File upload
When the file is passed on to server through the socket it becomes a ArrayBuffer, a Typed Array.
All other file information is stripped.  Therefore, it's important to save file information (name, type,size) in a variable before Ã 
passing it on to the server.

To display an image it must be wrapped in a URL object.
